				Reflection: Front-End or Back-End
			</h1>

			<p>Prior to starting at Omaha Code School, I was already "soul searching" on which emphasis (back-end or front-end) would be the one where I wouldn’t simply excel, but thrive. One of the questions I asked myself (after having now attained a better understanding of the distinction between the two) the most was this: do I see myself as more of an "artist" in front-end or a back-end "engineer" (for lack of better terms)? </p>

			<p>I also see the split between front-end and back-end this way: do I like using tools to shape things (front-end), or tools to build things (back-end)? I thought it’d be easier for me to grasp on to an emphasis of either, but there’s some pretty awesome merits to both. With front-end, it’s awesome to see the user experience thing shape, experimenting with color palettes. 
			I think the front-end allows me to *feel* more productive more quickly, and I love the artistic expression that comes from good front-end development. Implementing a design system can really make your brain muscles work to organize everything, and I’m pretty big on keeping things orderly (though my process can look horrendous on the way to Orderlytown).</p> 

			<p>Conversely, the tinkerer in me pulls me fairly hard towards the back-end. I just like knowing how things work, how to create things that work better, and being around and working with people that will stretch me and help me learn how to do things like this better. 
			At this point, it takes a longer time for me to *feel* productive on the back-end (as opposed to merely changing a background color in CSS class giving you nearly instant feedback). I don’t see results as quickly, and there’s not a lot of “pretty” coming from back-end efforts. However, I really like how it works my brain muscle. When I see something “working”, or “doing” what it does, I find that interesting. In these situations  it’s rarely satisfying for me to simply observe or understand what’s going on. I want to make it! 
			Moreover, I think about the flexibility I’d have in being able to make a web app for a future client. If they want something to “look” a certain way and I find it hideous, there’s not a lot I can do about swaying them. However, if they want their website to DO something, well, there’s little room for a client to demand I code some a specific way. They can tell me what the desired outcome would be for an app, and I still have some relative freedom with the naming conventions of my functions and how to structure the models/views/controls.</p>

			<p>In what language am I…
			more productive?
			more challenged?
			feeling more expressive?
			enjoying more generally?</p>

			<br>

			<p>Overall, I think the PHP language gives me the most positive responses to the above questions. Its challenged me to think outside of the box, to learn more about how to leverage the language itself, and how to start taking my abstract, far-fetched thinking and translate it into something tangible.
			Though my productivity can be slow starting out, I think I’m gaining economies of scale in a way that encourages me to try something different or new with the code. When using PHP, I only feel limited by my imagination on how to put something like a tic-tac-toe game together, whereas using CSS there are “rules” to structuring style that I find working against my nature more than I expected (though I greatly appreciate organization and structure). I’d say my initial instinct on preferring back-end still ring true.</p>
