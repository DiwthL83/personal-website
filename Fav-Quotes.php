	Anne Lamott, Author
	<br>
	<br>
	"I have a lot of faith. But I am also afraid a lot, and have no real certainty about anything. I remembered something Father Tom had told me--that the opposite of faith is not doubt, but certainty. Certainty is missing the point entirely. Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be there until some light returns."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Lighthouses don't go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Joy is the best makeup."
	<br>
	<br>

	Steven Furtick, Pastor/Author
	<br>
	<br>
	"Reputation is what others perceive you to be; character is what you ARE."
	<br>
	<br>
	"So you ask 'Why am I here?' God knows what's going to happen next, so He's always positioning you according to your purpose!"
	<br>
	<br>
	"Are you stable in your commitment? If you consult your emotions to determine whether to keep your commitment, you'll never be stable. When you have a strength you don't give an assignment to, it turns into apathy."
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Howard Thurman, Author/Theologian/Educator/Civil Rights Activist
	<br>
	<br>
	"Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive."
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States of America
	<br>
	<br>
	"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."
	<br>
	<br>
	"No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar."
	<br>
	<br>
	"I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong."
	<br>
	<br>
	"That some achieve great success, is proof to all that others can achieve it as well."
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Bishop T.D. Jakes, Pastor/Author
	<br>
	<br>
	"I think the first step is to understand that forgiveness does not exonerate the perpetrator. Forgiveness liberates the victim. It's a gift you give yourself."
	<br>
	<br>
	"We think that forgiveness is weakness, but it's absolutely not; it takes a very strong person to forgive."
	<br>
	<br>
	"But I think my mistakes became the chemistry for my miracles. I think that my tests became my testimonies."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Your faith won't exempt you from human reactions to life; life is life!"
	<br>
	<br>
	"You don't give to things you don't love."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Whatever area you are exceptional in, do not look for reciprocity. Don't expect your brothers to be fair. If you do, you'll be wounded because they do not have what it is that you have in that area. Do not look for fair reciprocity...God will make it up to you, not them."
