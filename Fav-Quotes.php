	<br>
	<br>
	"But I think my mistakes became the chemistry for my miracles. I think that my tests became my testimonies."

	"Your faith won't exempt you from human reactions to life; life is life!"
	<br>
	<br>
	"You don't give to things you don't love."
	<br>
	<br>
	"Whatever area you are exceptional in, do not look for reciprocity. Don't expect your brothers to be fair. If you do, you'll be wounded because they do not have what it is that you have in that area. Do not look for fair reciprocity...God will make it up to you, not them."
