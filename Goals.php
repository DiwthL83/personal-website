Q: <i>"What are your goals?"</i>
<br>
<p>
A: This is such a loaded question. How do you even begin to answer this completely?? Nonetheless, I'll give it a stab:<br> 
my goal is to be better than I was yesterday in the things that matter.

Q: <i>"Well, what 'matters'?"</i>
<br>
<br>
A: So glad you asked! This is much more robust conversation that merits an appropriate allocation of time/attention. How about when you have a free afternoon, let's get together for eggs, grits, bacon, toast, and orange juice, and talk about the things of this world that truly matter (bring an appetite).
